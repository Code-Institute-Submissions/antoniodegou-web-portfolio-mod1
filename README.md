## User Experience

### Initial Discussion

This project showcases the web Antonio de Gou's Full Stack Software portfolio and his introduction as a programmer. 
Antonio has the goal of entering the tech industry, and a portfolio is an essential tool that aims at professionals in the tech industry, such as employers, recruiters and other relevant peers.
There are a few goals from the get-go, it has to look professional, pixel perfect, showcase Antonio's personality, and ensure all the information is relevant and easy to find.


#### essential information for the website

1. Relevant information about Antonio.
2. tech skills.
3. Portfolio, code projects.
4. contact (form and relevant social media).
5. downloadable CV.

### User Stories

#### Client goals and first-time visitors

* To get all relevant information about Antonio.
* Contact Antonio through social media, email or form.
* Get the look and feel of personality through graphic design.
* See the essential projects Antonio has worked on.

#### Returning Visitor

* Have updated projects and status at all times.


## Design

### General design choices

The portfolio is a one-page design and separates all the information into sections.
The aesthetics are based on business cards with round corners, shadows and organised information by columns. 
The design is bold with a friendly side, the data is clear, and through Modals, more information and be unfolded.

### Colours 

![Colours I used](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniodegou/web-portfolio-mod1/main/readme-images/colours.jpg)

Sage and lemon combine to inspire stability and professionalism with friendliness and approachability. I worked out the colour scheme using Adobe Illustrator. The Design heavily relies on gradients, so blending the colours makes the look smoother, and the contrasting colours go together way better.


### Fonts

![Fonts I used](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniodegou/web-portfolio-mod1/main/readme-images/fonts.jpg)

I chose the fonts from [Fontshare](https://fontshare.com/), which has a curation of web fonts that are very design oriented. 
"Cabinet Grotesk" is a very detailed but sober font used for titles.
"Satoshi" is minimal with round lines, ideal for longer texts.
Both of these fonts have an interesting contrast between them.


### Imagery

![Assets i created](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniodegou/web-portfolio-mod1/main/readme-images/design-assets.jpg)

I based the design on geometric shapes, so all images are visual vector assets I made in Adobe Illustrator. They were then exported in SVG format and integrated into the HTML document. There is also a picture of Antonio in the about section. 


### Wireframes

I made the Wireframes with the Balsamiq App and projected three sizes from desktop to mobile.

## Features

I put all sections into one page with smooth scrolling: the header, about, skills, portfolio, contact and footer.
(404, 505 pages)

All Pages on the website are responsive and have the following:



### General

* A favicon and title in the browser tab.
* A logo on the left of Antonio.
* Smooth scrolling from that works in all browsers.
* Several SVGs integrated into the HTML file at times with animation.

### Header (opening section)

The opening section has both the menu and the header portion.
The menu has a logo on the left and the menu items on the right. When on mobile, the menu becomes an off-canvas menu.
The header comprises an SVG animation on the right and a card with the information on the left.
The animation is a simple metaphor for a system with rotating shapes and a 'gou.init()' text simulating the initiation of a program.
The title card had the name as a title, the professional title and a small piece of information about Antonio's website.

### About

The about section is about Antonio.
It has a picture of Antonio on the left with a composition of shapes that matches the website aesthetics. 
On the right is a title, a short description of Antonio and a button that opens a modal with more information about Antonio.

### Skills

A grid system organises the skills.
There's a short introduction and lists of Languages, Libraries and other tools that Antonio has worked with.
There is a shorter comment on languages and libraries that Antonio has used in his Generative art hobby.

### Portfolio

The most important part of the Website is the portfolio; for that reason, the design breaks from its normal flow and gets a different look.
Each project has a card in a carousel style that works on mobile with a horizontal scroll.
Each card has a button that opens a modal with more details about each project.
You can drag the portfolio with arrows or dragging, which works with the mouse and touch.

### Form

The primary way of contacting Antonio, even though it's a static website with the help of Formspree, is a working form. 

![Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoniodegou/web-portfolio-mod1/main/readme-images/05contact.jpg)

### Footer

The footer has a repetition of the smooth scrolling menu, social icons and another opportunity of downloading the CV.
Also, an "all right reserved" text and symbol.

### Future Implementations

* Have more complex projects on the portfolio
* Implement the website in React
* Ditch form spree and have a more robust implementation of server-side form.
* Ditch bootstrap to use Tailwind; it seems to be more of an industry standard.

### Accessibility

## Technologies Used

Balsamiq - For the wireframes.
Adobe Illustrator -  For the graphic design, design assets, and SVG export.
Git - Version Control.
GitHub - Host and save the website with version control.
Fontshare - Fonts for the website.
Visual Studio Code - Code editor.
Google Dev Tools - To troubleshoot and test features and solve issues with responsiveness and styling.
Favicon.io To create favicon.
Shields.io To add badges to the README.
Hoverify - responsiveness testing on several devices

### Vite JS (Frontend Tooling)

Vite js is a great starter project; you can add any dependencies and have live reloading as you save your HTML or CSS. In addition, it updates all browsers automatically.
Some of their features go over my head, but one that gave me peace of mind was that it gets rid of any code that is not in use; for example, non of the bootstrap classes that are not in use do not get passed to the final CSS file. So that makes for smaller files. 
There is also a separation of production files and final files.


### Languages Used

 HTML, CSS, JavaScript

As expected, I used HTML for structure, CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity and functionality. Important to mention that there is heavy use of SVG for all graphic assets.


### Libraries Used

1. SASS

I decided to use SASS because I like their implementation of variables; I also appreciate having the ability to have several files organised.

2. Bootstrap v.5

My primary motivation for Bootstrap use was their grid system, spacing, and responsiveness; once I got the hang of it, it made it much faster to have all spacing work on all devices.
I also used their nav bar, off-canvas nav bar, and Modals to show more information as needed and keep a clean-looking website. 


3. Formspree

I wanted a working form, but still, I can host it on GitHub; I found this solution that, with a bit of javascript, sends an email to me if someone uses the form.

4. Glider.js

In the design process, I wanted the portfolio section to have a different style than the rest of the website. 
I liked the idea of a carousel that scrolls horizontally, with arrows and dragging. Unfortunately, BootStrap carousel didn't do exactly what I wanted, so I implemented the library glider that did precisely what I wanted. 

5. SVGInject

This small JS library came from the necessity of having my SVG's integrated into the HTML without bloating the HTML page. 
Even though there are many methods to do so without a library, it was very challenging to keep the CSS and the animation working whilst having separate files just for SVG. The only tag that allowed me to do that was <embed>, but not only does it seem deprecated, but it was also very ineffective for Accessibility purposes. So I resorted to this library that substitutes my <img> tags with their respective SVG.
