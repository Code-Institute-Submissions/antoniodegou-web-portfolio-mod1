## User Experience

### Initial Discussion

This project showcases the web Antonio de Gou's Full Stack Software portfolio and his introduction as a programmer.

3. Portfolio, code projects.
4. contact (form and relevant social media).
5. downloadable CV.

## Design

### General design choices

(two main design inspirations)

The portfolio is a one-page design and separates all the information into sections.
The aesthetics are based on business cards with round corners, shadows and organised information by columns. 
The design is bold with a friendly side, the information is clear, and through Modals, more information and be unfolded.

### colours and fonts

(colour pic)
Sage and lemon combine to inspire stability and professionalism with friendliness and approachability. I worked out the colour scheme using Adobe Illustrator. 

### fonts
I chose the fonts from https://www.fontshare.com/, which has a curation of web fonts that are very design oriented. 
"Cabinet Grotesk" is a very detailed but sober font used for titles.
"Satoshi" is minimal with round lines, ideal for longer texts.
Both of these fonts have an interesting contrast between them.

### Imagery

I based the design on geometric shapes, so all images are visual vector assets I made in Adobe Illustrator. They were then exported in SVG format and integrated into the HTML document. There is also a picture of Antonio in the about section. 


### Wireframes

I made the Wireframes with the Balsamiq App and projected three sizes from desktop to mobile.

## Features

I put all sections into one page with smooth scrolling: the header, about, skills, portfolio, contact and footer.
(404, 505 pages)

All Pages on the website are responsive and have the following:

* A favicon in the browser tab and title.
* Horizontal menu that on mobile becomes off-canvas navigation.
* SVG integration at times with animation.

### General

* A favicon and title in the browser tab.
* A logo on the left of Antonio.
* Smooth scrolling from that works in all browsers.
* Several SVGs integrated into the HTML file at times with animation.

### Header (opening section)

The opening section has both the menu and the header portion.
The menu has a logo on the left and the menu items on the right. When on mobile, the menu becomes an off-canvas menu.
The header comprises an SVG animation on the right and a card with the information on the left.
The animation is a simple metaphor for a system with rotating shapes and a 'gou.init()' text simulating the initiation of a program.
The title card had the name as a title, the professional title and a small piece of information about Antonio's website.


### About

The about section is about Antonio.
It has a picture of Antonio on the left with a composition of shapes that matches the website aesthetics. 
On the right is a title, a short description of Antonio and a button that opens a modal with more information about Antonio.


### Skills

A grid system organises the skills.
There's a short introduction and lists of Languages, Libraries and other tools that Antonio has worked with.
There is a shorter comment on languages and libraries that Antonio has used in his Generative art hobby.

### Portfolio

The most important part of the Website is the portfolio; for that reason, the design breaks from its normal flow and gets a different look.
Each project has a card in a carousel style that works on mobile with a horizontal scroll.
Each card has a button that opens a modal with more details about each project.
You can drag the portfolio with arrows or dragging. It works with the mouse and touch.

### Form

The primary way of contacting Antonio, even though it's a static website with the help of Formspree, is a working form. 

### Footer

The footer has a repetition of the smooth scrolling menu, social icons and another opportunity of downloading the CV.
Also, an "all right reserved" text and symbol.
